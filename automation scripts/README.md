The combination scripts are for automating browsers to generate LCOE and GHG/GWP for all combinations of forest treatments and harvesting systems.

The `combinationGeneral` script automates runs for all combinations except for T4 (Timber Salvage) as no combination with T4 can yield results at this point due to issue#205.

The `combinationPUCS` script was created for running the PUCS case study where for some combinations the available biomass in the Sierra Nevada region (the current resource data) is insufficient in meeting the 20-year feedstock demand.

The sensitivity scripts are for automating browsers to generate LCOE and GHG/GWP for sensitivity analysis

The `sensitivityGeneral` script is used for the GPO and CHP models.

The `sensitivityGP` script is used for the GP model.

The `expansionFactor` script is for generating LCOE and GHG/GWP using the expansion factors of 1 to 50.
